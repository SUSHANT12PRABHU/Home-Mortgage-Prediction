# Home-Mortgage-Prediction
Applied Machine Learning Project

## Background & Context to the Problem Statement -
Purchasing a home is a substantial financial endeavor. It is an overwhelming process that can take several months of searching through properties, securing finances, submitting offers, and finally, closing on a home. Arguably, securing the finances itself presents an obstacle for many home-buyers - first time or experienced, where the buyer is forced to submit several applications to various lenders. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to home-loan applications data to predict approvals and unlock insights into the home lending market. One possible area to explore is how certain sensitive features, for example - applicant’s race or gender - do or don’t have an impact on likelihood of loan approval, to better understand the likelihood of an application being accepted or rejected for a home loan. This will enhance the home buying process to be more streamlined, a benefit for both the lender and the applicant.

## Identification and Description of the Data set along with their source -
Description : The primary data set will be Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data that is reported by mortgage lenders and maintained by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The Bureau describes the HMDA as the most comprehensive source of publicly available information on the U.S. mortgage market. The CFPB maintains the data from the years 2007-2021 on a public website. Most years have at least 5 million rows. The data set contains financial information such as the amount of credit granted, the income of the applicant, and the loan terms, as well as more categorical information such as the applicant’s race, age, and sex.
